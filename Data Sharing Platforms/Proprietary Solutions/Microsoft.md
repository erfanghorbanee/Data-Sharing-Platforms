# üß© Microsoft Excel Co‚ÄëAuthoring Architecture: Synchronization Model

Microsoft Excel's real-time co-authoring‚Äîwhether in Excel for the web or desktop via OneDrive/SharePoint‚Äîrelies on a **centralized, server-mediated architecture**.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Synchronization Technique: **Operational Transformation (OT)**

Microsoft does not officially reveal the exact algorithm used for conflict resolution in Excel or Office 365. However, research and expert sources suggest that **Operational Transformation (OT)** is the main method behind Microsoft‚Äôs co-authoring system.

## üß™ Supporting Evidence

* A peer-reviewed analysis comparing OT and CRDT explicitly states:

  > ‚ÄúOT has been successfully applied in many industrial real-time co-editors including Google Docs, Etherpad, and Microsoft co-authoring systems‚Äù

  [Real Differences between OT and CRDT for Co-Editors*, Sun et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02137)

* Microsoft‚Äôs official documentation outlines a **centralized, autosave-based, versioned co-authoring model**, which is consistent with OT-style architecture

## Architectural Features

| Feature                        | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Centralized Sync**           | Edits are routed through SharePoint/OneDrive cloud services                |
| **Sequential Operation Log**   | Central server applies operations                          |
| **Autosave + Lock-Free**       | Changes are auto-saved, and multiple users can edit without explicit locks |
| **Operational Transformation** | Likely used to resolve concurrent edits and maintain document consistency  |
