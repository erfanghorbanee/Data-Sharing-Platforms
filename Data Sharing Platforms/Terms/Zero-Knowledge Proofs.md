# Zero-Knowledge Proofs

**Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** are cryptographic protocols that allow one party (the **prover**) to convince another party (the **verifier**) that a statement is true **without revealing any information beyond the truth of the statement**.

This concept is central to privacy-preserving systems and trustless verification mechanisms.

## Core Properties

A valid zero-knowledge proof must satisfy:

- **Completeness**: If the statement is true, the verifier will be convinced.
- **Soundness**: If the statement is false, a cheating prover cannot convince the verifier.
- **Zero-knowledge**: The verifier learns nothing except that the statement is true.

## Simple Analogy

Imagine proving you know the password to a locked door **without revealing the password**. You go through the door and come back through a secret path that only someone with the password could access. The verifier sees this and is convinced â€” without ever learning the password.

## Applications

- **Authentication without revealing credentials**.
- **Blockchain privacy** (e.g., Zcash using zk-SNARKs).
- **Secure voting systems**.
- **Verifiable data sharing** where access is proven, not exposed.

## Relevance to Data Sharing Platforms

In data-sharing contexts, ZKPs can be used to:

- Verify that a user has permission to access data **without revealing the data itself**.
- Prove that data computations were done correctly **without revealing inputs** (e.g., in secure multiparty computation).
- Enhance **auditing and compliance** without violating privacy.

While still computationally expensive for general-purpose use, newer protocols (e.g., zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs) are making ZKPs more practical in distributed and privacy-sensitive systems.
