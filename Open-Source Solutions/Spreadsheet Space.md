# Spreadsheet Space

Spreadsheet Space is a platform that makes Microsoft Excel smarter, more connected, and always up to date.
It solves the problem of multiple file versions, outdated data, and endless email attachments by keeping spreadsheets linked and synchronized.

## How It Works

Spreadsheet Space is built on a technology called **Sharing through Synchronization**.
Instead of sending files back and forth, it keeps Excel spreadsheets in sync by exchanging encrypted updates.
This ensures everyone always works on the latest version, with full security.

## Main Features

### 1. **Share**

* Co-edit Excel files like in Google Docs, but directly in Excel.
* Works in real-time (simultaneous editing) or deferred mode (different times).
* Secure: files never leave your system unencrypted.

### 2. **Link**

* Connect Excel spreadsheets together.
* Publish a table, range, or sheet as a ‚ÄúView‚Äù and let others link to it.
* Updates flow automatically ‚Äî no more email attachments or version confusion.
* Supports forms: one user creates a form, others fill it, and all data stays connected.

### 3. **Sync**

* Connect Excel to company databases or platforms.
* Admins expose selected data views (not direct database access).
* Excel users can build live reports and dashboards that update automatically.
* Benefits:

  * **Security** ‚Äì users don‚Äôt need database credentials.
  * **Scalability** ‚Äì avoids heavy loads on IT systems.
  * **Control** ‚Äì admins decide who sees what and how often it updates.

## Why Use Spreadsheet Space?

* Always up-to-date data (‚ÄúSingle Version of the Truth‚Äù).
* Works inside Excel ‚Äî no need to switch to web apps.
* Strong encryption and enterprise-grade security.
* Easy to install as an Excel Add-In (no admin rights needed).
* Supports both public cloud and private enterprise setups.
